MPCS 52011 - Project 6
------------------------------
An assembler was implemented using python and can be found in proj6.py.

To run the program, utilize a command line argument with the filepath of the
asm file to be converted into a .hack file:

    $ python3 assembler.py /FILE/PATH

The .hack file will be found in the same directory as the .asm file used
to run the program on. The subsequent .hack file can be used for testing.

I tested my program by running the assembler on the different .asm files to
generate a .hack file. I then used the assembler tool to compare the output
of the .asm test files with my assembler .hack output. The comparisons
ended successfully so there shouldn't be any issues.
